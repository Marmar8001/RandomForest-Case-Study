# RandomForest-Case-Study

This case study was designed to drive home the important role that data science plays in real-world situations like this pandemic. This case study uses the Random Forest Classifier and a dataset from the South Korean cases of COVID-19 provided on Kaggle to encourage research on this important topic. The goal of the case study is to build a Random Forest Classifier to predict the 'state' of the patient.

The overall steps are:

**Data Wrangling:**
* Identifying missing values and impute them with mean, median and mode when applicable.

**Explatorary Data Analysis:**
* Identifying outliers

**Scaling, modeling and feature imporatnce**
